## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems Faced & Solutions

### 1. **TypeScript & ESLint Errors**
- **Problem:** Type mismatches, missing types, and incorrect context usage caused build failures.
- **Solution:** Refactored all files for strict typing, fixed all context providers/consumers, and updated type definitions.

### 2. **Tailwind CSS Integration**
- **Problem:** Custom color classes (e.g., `primary-500`) and `@apply` rules were not recognized due to misconfigured Tailwind setup.
- **Solution:** Updated `tailwind.config.js` to include a custom `primary` palette and ensured all Tailwind directives were at the top of `index.css`.

### 3. **Vite/PostCSS Build Errors**
- **Problem:** `@import` statements for Google Fonts were placed after Tailwind directives, causing build errors.
- **Solution:** Moved all `@import` statements to the very top of the CSS file as required by Vite/PostCSS.

### 4. **Context & Import Path Issues**
- **Problem:** Incorrect or outdated import paths and context property usage led to runtime errors.
- **Solution:** Audited and fixed all import paths and context usages to match the actual file structure and exported properties.

### 5. **Mock Crypto Implementation**
- **Problem:** For demo purposes, real cryptography was not implemented, but the architecture needed to be extensible and safe for future upgrades.
- **Solution:** Stubbed and strongly typed all crypto utility functions, with clear comments for future replacement with real crypto libraries.

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Is this app secure for real-world sensitive data?**
> This project uses mock/stubbed crypto for demonstration. For production, integrate a real cryptography library and audit all security aspects.

**Q: How do I add a new encryption algorithm?**
> Add your algorithm to `src/utils/Cryptoutils.tsx` and update the UI in the forms/components as needed.

**Q: Why do I see Tailwind or PostCSS errors?**
> Ensure all `@import` statements are at the top of your CSS and that your Tailwind config matches the docs.

**Q: How do I run tests?**
> Use `npm run test` to run all unit and integration tests.
